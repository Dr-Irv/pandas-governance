# _pandas_ Project Governance and Decision-Making

The purpose of this document is to formalize the governance process used by the pandas
project in both ordinary and extraordinary situations, and to clarify how decisions are
made and how the various elements of our community interact, including the relationship
between open source collaborative development and work that may be funded by for-profit
or non-profit entities.

Summary
=======
_pandas_ is a community-owned and community-run project. Major technical changes to the
project are managed by the PDEP (pandas enhancement proposal) process, described in
PDEP-1 at https://pandas.pydata.org/pdeps/0001-purpose-and-guidelines.html .  Because of
the large scope of the project, the project is managed by a number of different teams,
who each have responsibilities for different aspects of the project.  A Steering
Committee, elected on an annual basis, coordinates the activities of the different
teams.

The Project
===========

The pandas Project (The Project) is an open source software project sponsored
by the 501(c)3 NumFOCUS Foundation. NumFOCUS provides pandas with fiscal, legal, and
administrative support to help ensure the health and sustainability of the project.
The goal of The Project is to develop open
source software that is the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical,
real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming
the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available
in any language. The Software developed by
The Project is released under the BSD (or similar) open source license,
developed openly and hosted on public GitHub repositories under the [`pandas-dev`
GitHub organization](https://github.com/pandas-dev).  Examples of Project Software
include the main pandas code repository, pandas website, `pandas-stubs` and the
pandas-datareader add-on library.

The Project is developed by a team of distributed developers, called
Contributors. Contributors are individuals who have contributed code,
documentation, designs or other work to one or more Project repositories.
Anyone can be a Contributor. Contributors can be affiliated with any legal
entity or none. Contributors participate in the project by submitting,
reviewing and discussing GitHub Pull Requests and Issues and participating in
open and public Project discussions on GitHub, mailing lists, and
other channels. The foundation of Project participation is openness and
transparency.


The Project Community consists of all Contributors and Users of the Project.
Contributors work on behalf of and are responsible to the larger Project
Community and we strive to keep the barrier between Contributors and Users as
low as possible.
The Project is formally affiliated with the 501(c)3 NumFOCUS Foundation
([http://numfocus.org](http://numfocus.org)), which serves as its fiscal
sponsor, may hold project trademarks and other intellectual property, helps
manage project donations and acts as a parent legal entity. NumFOCUS is the
only legal entity that has a formal relationship with the project (see
Institutional Partners section below).

Governance
==========

This section describes the governance and leadership model of The Project.

The foundations of Project governance are:

-   Openness & Transparency
-   Active Contribution
-   Institutional Neutrality

To manage the project, there are different Teams that each have responsibility for
specific aspects of the project. Collectively, the members of all Teams are referred to
as _Stewards_ of the project.

Steering Committee
==================

The role of the _pandas_ Steering Committee is to coordinate the activities of the
different Teams and to ensure that different policies and procedures are carried out in
a consistent manner. The Steering Committee has no routine decision-making authority,
except as detailed herein, although in exceptional circumstances it may be called upon
from time to time to make decisions that are in the best interest of The Project as a
whole. The Steering Committee will itself decide when a circumstance is exceptional.

**THE DETAILS OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE AND THE TEAMS AND WILL BE IN A SEPARATE
PULL REQUEST**

### Conflict of interest

It is expected that all Stewards will be employed at a wide
range of companies, universities and non-profit organizations. Because of this,
it is possible that Stewards will have conflict of interests. Such conflict of
interests include, but are not limited to:

-   Financial interests, such as investments, employment or contracting work,
    outside of The Project that may influence their work on The Project.
-   Access to proprietary information of their employer that could potentially
    leak into their work with the Project.

All Stewards shall disclose to the Steering Committee
any conflict of interest they may have. Stewards with a conflict of
interest in a particular issue may participate in Team discussions on that
issue, but must recuse themselves from voting on the issue, if such
a vote is necessary.

### Private communications of the Steering Committee

To the maximum extent possible, Team discussions and activities will be
public and done in collaboration and discussion with the Project Contributors
and Community. The Steering Committee will have a private mailing list that will be used
sparingly and only when a specific matter requires privacy. When private
communications and decisions are needed, the Steering Committee will do its best to
summarize those to the Community after eliding personal/private/sensitive
information that should not be posted to the public internet.


Institutional Partners and Funding
==================================

The Stewards are the primary leaders of the project. No outside
institution, individual or legal entity has the ability to own, control, usurp
or influence the project other than by participating in the Project as
Contributors and Stewards. However, because institutions can be an important
funding mechanism for the project, it is important to formally acknowledge
institutional participation in the project. These are Institutional Partners.
An Institutional Contributor is any individual Project Contributor who
contributes to the project as part of their official duties at an Institutional
Partner. Likewise, an Institutional Steward is any Steward
who contributes to the project as part of their official duties at an
Institutional Partner.
With these definitions, an Institutional Partner is any recognized legal entity
in the United States or elsewhere that employs at least one Institutional
Contributor or Institutional Steward. Institutional Partners can be
for-profit or non-profit entities.
Institutions become eligible to become an Institutional Partner by employing
individuals who actively contribute to The Project as part of their official
duties. To state this another way, the only way for an Institutional Partner to
influence the project is by actively contributing to the open development of
the project, on equal terms with any other member of the community of
Contributors and Stewards. Merely using Project Software in
an institutional context does not allow an entity to become an Institutional
Partner. Financial gifts, which are recognized on the _pandas_ web site,
do not enable an entity to become an Institutional
Partner. Once an institution becomes eligible for Institutional Partnership,
the Steering Committee must nominate and approve the Partnership.
If at some point an existing Institutional Partner stops having any contributing
employees, then a one year grace period commences. If at the end of this one year period
they continue to not have any contributing employees, then their Institutional
Partnership will lapse, and resuming it will require going through the normal process
for new Partnerships.

An Institutional Partner is free to pursue funding for their work on The
Project through any legal means. This could involve a non-profit organization
raising money from private foundations and donors or a for-profit company
building proprietary products and services that leverage Project Software and
Services. Funding acquired by Institutional Partners to work on The Project is
called Institutional Funding. However, no funding obtained by an Institutional
Partner can override the Steering Committee. If a Partner has funding
to do pandas work and the Steering Committee decides to not pursue that work as a
project, the Partner is free to pursue it on their own. However in this
situation, that part of the Partnerâ€™s work will not be under the pandas
umbrella and cannot use the Project trademarks in a way that suggests a formal
relationship.

Institutional Partner benefits are:

- Acknowledged on the _pandas_ website, in talks and T-shirts.
- Ability to acknowledge their own funding sources on the _pandas_ websites, in
  talks and T-shirts.
- Ability to influence the project through the participation of their Steward.

A list of current Institutional Partners is maintained at the page
https://pandas.pydata.org/about/sponsors.html .
